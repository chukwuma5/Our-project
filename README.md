  ## My Challanges and lessons
   Learnt how to re-size pictures with percentages firstly, used my fontsizes well, my nav-bar saga, which was quite taskful at the beginning with, and also the entire structure of  the Webpage. It was intersting, and i came up with this nav-section for mobile view:

   ## Best syntax Used

    ``CSS
   (transform), (flex-box), and (power of proper font usage).
  Transform is very important for efficient animations to improver the ui's of a website, with the flex-box to avoid dis-mantle of sections and our all underrated font usage.
